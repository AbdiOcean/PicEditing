        <h1>*Picture Editing</h1>
        <p>It is not a must to do picture editing, the essence is just 
            to make the image more alive and more attractive.
        </p>
        <p>Look at this perspective, during the old times, pictures 
            were in black and white because the technology of colour capture 
            was not up yet. In this times, where the camera is enhanced and able
            to bring out a clear focus of an image of an object and producing
            almost the exact replica.
        </p>
        <p>Boosting the contrast of an image, croping an image, increasing
            the brightness and other many types of edits, show an appearance
            of a lively photo.
