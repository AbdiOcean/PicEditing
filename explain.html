    <h1>*Picture Editing</h1>
    <p>It is not a must to do picture editing, the essence is just 
        to make the image more alive and more attractive.
    </p>
    <p>Look at this perspective, during the old times, pictures 
        were in black and white because the technology of colour capture 
        was not up yet. In this times, where the camera is enhanced and able
        to bring out a clear focus of an image of an object and producing
        almost the exact replica.
    </p>
    <p>Boosting the contrast of an image, croping an image, increasing
        the brightness and other many types of edits, show an appearance
        of a lively photo.
    </p>
    <h2>"Old edits"</h2>
    <p>As the name speaks for itself, the type of picture editing
        tends to make appearance of a photo be a little bit aged,
        maybe by:black and white, paper appearance and other different
        effects. For example, observe the picturres below...
    </p>
    <img src="hood.jpg"><img class="mavin" src="mavin.jpg "><img class="arafat" src="arafat.jpg">
    <img src="bandana.jpg"><p class="NB">Take note that the 
        camera which took this photos was a 21<sup>st</sup> century smartphone.
    </p>
    <p>Even though the last photo is not black and white, the graphics
        show that it appears
        to be taken during the 80s or 90s.
    </p>
    <h2>"cartoon Edits"</h2>
    <p>In this type of edit, images tend to like a cartoon or something
        funny or easily drawn.
