        tends to make appearance of a photo be a little bit aged,
        maybe by:black and white, paper appearance and other different
        effects. For example, observe the picturres below...

        <img src="images/hood.jpg"><img class="mavin" src="images/mavin.jpg "><img class="arafat" src="images/arafat.jpg">
        <img src="images/bandana.jpg"> <img src="images/shipa.jpg">
    </div>
    
    <p class="NB">Take note that the 
        camera which took this photos was a 21<sup>st</sup> century smartphone.

    <p>Even though the last photo is not black and white, the graphics
        show that it appears
        to be taken during the 80s or 90s.
